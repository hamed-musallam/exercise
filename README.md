## Goal

The goal is to fork this project under your github username and create a webpage that plots the function:

```
f(x) = sin(x);
```

between 0 and 360 degrees and preferably show the axis.

The plot should be render in SVG and no library should be used. Feel free to add extra functionalities. We like documentation and projects that are split in small files.

Once the project is finished you may send us the link to your repository.
